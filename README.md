# Machine-Learning-Project-2
The loan prediction dataset contains information about clients who applied for loans, including their personal and financial details. The dataset has 36 features, which can be broadly categorized into three groups: demographic, financial, and loan-related information. Demographic features include factors such as age, gender, marital status, and occupation, while financial features cover income, credit amount, credit score, and default history. Loan-related features, on the other hand, capture information about the loan contract type, annuity, and application process.

From a machine learning perspective, it is crucial to understand the relationships between these features and the target variable, 'Default,' which indicates whether a client defaulted on their loan payments. Some of these features, such as credit score and income, may have strong predictive power, while others may be less relevant. It is also essential to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and potential multicollinearity issues to ensure the performance and stability of the predictive models.

From a business perspective, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on their loan. This information can help the lending institution make better-informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, and risk management. By minimizing the occurrence of loan defaults, the institution can improve its overall profitability and maintain a healthy loan portfolio.
